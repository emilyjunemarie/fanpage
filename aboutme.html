    <p class="para">My name is Draco Malfoy and I am a wizard. I was born June 5, 1980 to two British wizards, Lucius
      and Narcissa Malfoy. I grew up attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where I was placed into the Slytherin House. Growing
      up as the son of a Death Eater, I was raised on very strict beliefs. Similar to my known rival Harry Potter, many call me "The Chosen One
      of the Dark Side" due to my leniant obidience to the Dark Lord. I have struggled to find my own courage, but there are wizards out there, as well
      as muggles, who know who I truly am and what I stand for.
